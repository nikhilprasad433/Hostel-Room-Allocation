🎯 What Is GitHub?
GitHub is like Google Drive for your code — a place where you can upload and share your project with others (like your teacher or teammates). It also helps you save your work online and show your project to the world.

🟢 Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
Open your browser and go to: https://github.com

Click Sign up (top right)

Enter: Username (your name or nickname)

Email

Password

Click Continue and complete the verification (they may show puzzles or CAPTCHAs).

Done! ✅ You're now on GitHub.

🟢 Step 2: Create a New Repository (Project Folder)
After logging in, click the + icon (top right) → New repository

Fill in the form:

Field	         What to type
Repository name	 hostel-room-allocation
Description	 Java project for managing hostel rooms
Visibility	 Public (so teacher can see)
Initialize README	❌ (leave this unchecked)

Click Create repository

🟢 Step 3: Upload Your Project Code
Now you need to send your code from your computer to GitHub.

OPTION A: The Easiest Way (No Git, Just Upload from Website)
On your repo page, click "Add file" → "Upload files"

Drag and drop your src folder (and your .java files inside it)

Also upload your README.md file (I gave you the content earlier!)

After uploading, scroll down and click Commit changes

✅ Boom! Your project is online.

🟢 Step 4: Add README.md (If not already)
On your repo, click “Add file” → “Create new file”

Type the name: README.md

Paste this content:
